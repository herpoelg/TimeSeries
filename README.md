Repository for timeseries analysis. Currently containing 2 projects: sunspots and globallandtemperatures

### Sunspots

In this notebook a univariate timeseries is being analysed. 
First the data is being explored. 
After the exploration 3 different kinds of models are being developed: a naive forecast, an ARIMA model and finaly a Facebook Prophet model.

### Global Land Temperatures

In this notebook the GlobalTemperatures.csv dataset is being explored. Others, such as the GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity and the GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry datasets have been left out.

The first part is about exploring and visualising the data. This is also the focus of this notebook. In the second part 2 predictive models have been generated: an ARIMA model and a Facebook Prophet model.
